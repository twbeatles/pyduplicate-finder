# 🔍 PyDuplicate Finder Pro

[![한국어](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-한국어-red.svg)](README.md)

**PyDuplicate Finder Pro** is a high-performance duplicate file management tool built with Python (PySide6). It leverages advanced multi-threading and smart caching to quickly and accurately scan for duplicate files even in large file systems, providing safe Undo capabilities.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 High Performance
- **Ultra-Fast Scanning**: Recursive `os.scandir` engine for significantly faster file traversal compared to `os.walk`.
- **Optimized Hashing (BLAKE2b)**: Uses `BLAKE2b` algorithm optimized for 64-bit systems, faster and more secure than MD5.
- **Smart Caching & Batch Processing**: `SQLite WAL` mode with batch processing handles hundreds of thousands of files seamlessly.
- **Resume Interrupted Scans**: File lists and hash progress are cached so scans can resume after a restart.
- **Smooth UI**: Incremental rendering of results keeps the app responsive even with massive datasets.

### 🛡️ Safety & Precision
- **System Protection**: Automatically skips critical system folders (Windows, Program Files, etc.) to prevent accidental damage.
- **Physical Duplicate Prevention (Inode Check)**: Prevents counting symbolic links or shortcuts as duplicates of the same physical file.
- **Safe Delete & Robust Undo**: Asynchronous delete/restore operations keep UI responsive when processing thousands of files.
- **Recycle Bin Option**: Move files to system Recycle Bin instead of permanent deletion.
- **File Lock Detection**: Automatically detects files in use by other processes before deletion.
- **Persistent Quarantine + Retention**: Undoable deletes are kept in persistent Quarantine and cleaned by configured retention rules (age/size).

### 🎨 Modern UI & User Experience
- **Multiple Scan Modes**: 
    - **Similar Image Detection (pHash)**: Finds visually similar images (resized, recompressed, etc.)
    - **Filename Comparison**: Quickly finds files with the same name regardless of content.
- **Exclude Patterns**: Skip unwanted folders/files like `node_modules`, `.git`, `*.tmp` using wildcard patterns (*, ?).
- **Scan Presets**: Save and load frequently used scan configurations.
- **Result Save/Load**: Export scan results to JSON and reload later.
  - New saves use the common `version=2` schema, and the loader remains backward-compatible with legacy GUI/CLI JSON formats.
- **Session Restore**: Detects the latest session and lets you resume or start a new scan.
- **Intuitive Tree View**: Expand/collapse all groups, right-click context menu for quick actions.
- **Custom Shortcuts**: Configure keyboard shortcuts for all functions.
- **Multi-language Support**: Full Korean and English interface support.

### 🧰 Tools
- **Quarantine Management**: Files deleted in undoable mode are moved to Quarantine; restore or permanently purge them later.
- **Selection Rules**: Define ordered KEEP/DELETE rules using fnmatch-style wildcards and apply them to groups/results.
- **Operations Log**: Tracks operations (delete/restore/purge/hardlink, etc.) and supports per-item details plus CSV/JSON export.
- **Preflight Checks**: Runs safety checks (locks/permissions/volume constraints) before advanced operations.
- **Hardlink Consolidation (Advanced)**: Consolidate duplicates via hardlinks to reduce disk usage (optional).

## 📥 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher

### Dependencies
| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| PySide6 | Qt GUI framework |
| imagehash | Similar image detection (pHash) |
| Pillow | Image processing |
| send2trash | Recycle Bin functionality |
| psutil | File lock process detection |

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PyDuplicateFinder.git
   cd PyDuplicateFinder
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 📖 Usage Guide

### 1. Run the Program
```bash
python main.py
```

### (Optional) Run a headless CLI scan
```bash
python cli.py "D:/Data" "E:/Photos" --extensions jpg,png --output-json result.json --output-csv result.csv
```
- `--similarity-threshold` only accepts values in `0.0`~`1.0`. Out-of-range input is rejected with CLI error (`SystemExit 2`).
- When `--similar-image` or `--mixed-mode` is requested, missing `imagehash`/`Pillow` dependencies cause immediate fail-fast exit.
- `--mixed-mode` implicitly enables the similar-image pass (no separate `--similar-image` flag required).

### (Optional) Run strict-mode CLI scan with telemetry
```bash
python cli.py "D:/Data" --strict-mode --strict-max-errors 0 --output-json result.json
```

### 2. Search Settings
- **Add Location**: Use "Add Folder" or Drag & Drop to add search targets.
- **Filter Options**:
    | Option | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | Filename Only | Compare names only, skip content hashing (ultra-fast) |
    | Similar Image Detection | Analyze visual similarity (0.1~1.0 threshold) |
    | Strict Mode | Marks scan as `partial` when error count exceeds threshold |
    | Use Recycle Bin | Move to Recycle Bin instead of permanent delete |
    | Skip hidden/system files | Skips dotfiles and OS metadata files |
    | Follow symlinks | Follows symbolic links (loop detection enabled) |
    | Include patterns | If set, only matching files are scanned |
    | Exclude Patterns | Set wildcard patterns (*, ?) to skip during scan |

### 3. Scan & Review
- **Start Scan**: Click to begin high-speed scanning.
- **Cancel Scan**: Stop anytime during scanning.
- **Resume Scan**: On relaunch, the app asks whether to resume an interrupted scan.
- **Review Results**:
    - View duplicate groups in the left tree view
    - Use `+`/`-` buttons to expand/collapse all
    - Click a file to see **Preview** in the right panel

### 4. Organize & Delete
- **Auto Select (Smart)**: Keep oldest file as original, select rest for deletion
- **Delete Selected**: Safely delete after lock detection
- **Undo**: Press `Ctrl+Z` to restore (except when using Recycle Bin)

### 5. Advanced Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Save/Load Results | Manage scan results as JSON files |
| Preset Management | Save/load frequently used configurations |
| Shortcut Settings | Customize keyboard shortcuts |
| Find Empty Folders | Scan and batch delete empty folders |
| Quarantine | Restore/purge files deleted in undoable mode |
| Selection Rules | Pattern-based KEEP/DELETE auto-selection |
| Operations Log | Operation history with details + CSV/JSON export |
| Hardlink Consolidation | (Advanced) Save disk space via hardlinks |
| Scheduled Scan Snapshot | Scheduled runs use saved config snapshot (`scan_jobs.config_json`); if some folders are missing, run valid folders only; if all are missing, mark run as `skipped(no_valid_folders)` |
| Cache Retention Policy | Configure session keep count (`cache/session_keep_latest`) and hash cache retention days (`cache/hash_cleanup_days`) and apply immediately |
| Headless CLI Scan | Run scans without GUI and export JSON/CSV outputs |

### Result JSON format (manual/scheduled/CLI)
- New format: `{"meta": {...}, "results": {...}}`
- Backward compatible loading: legacy `{"<group_key>": [...]}` is still accepted.
- `meta` includes:
  - `scan_status` (`completed` or `partial`)
  - `metrics` (`files_scanned`, `files_hashed`, `files_skipped_error`, `files_skipped_locked`, `errors_total`)
  - `warnings` (for example `strict_mode_threshold_exceeded`)

## ✅ Implementation Status (2026-02-26)

The following items are now implemented in code:

- Advanced scan options exposed in GUI: mixed mode, duplicate-folder detection, incremental rescan, baseline session selector
- CLI extensions: `--mixed-mode`, `--detect-folder-dup`, `--incremental-rescan`, `--baseline-session`
- CLI validation: `--similarity-threshold` is constrained to `0.0~1.0` (out-of-range input rejected)
- Delete dry-run summary: selected/visible counts, estimated reclaim size, per-group preview before destructive flow
- Retry scope expansion: retries now cover hardlink/restore/purge failures in addition to delete failures
- i18n cleanup: core hardcoded messages (Undo/Redo/Quarantine/History) migrated to translation keys
- Scheduled scan (baseline): daily/weekly scheduling from Settings with optional JSON/CSV auto-export
- Scheduled execution policy: run from saved snapshot (`scan_jobs.config_json`) rather than current UI state; folder handling is `run valid folders only / all missing -> skipped(no_valid_folders)`
- Results/export enhancements: better `FOLDER_DUP` labels and CSV columns `group_kind`, `bytes_reclaim_est`, `baseline_delta`
- Unified result JSON schema: GUI/CLI now save `version=2`, while loader supports legacy GUI/legacy CLI/v2 formats
- Safer quarantine path: DB insert failure now triggers rollback to original path (prevents orphaned files)
- Preview concurrency hardening: cache updates are lock-protected (`RLock`) and preview signal is connected with `Qt.QueuedConnection`
- Preset schema alignment: writes `schema_version=2` and upgrades old presets by merging missing defaults
- Strict schedule validation: invalid `HH:MM (00:00-23:59)` input is blocked with user-facing error
- Cache/session cleanup policy: startup cleanup now follows configurable `session_keep_latest` and `hash_cleanup_days`
- Incremental CSV detail: file-level `baseline_delta` now records `new|changed|revalidated`
- Similar-image dependency policy: GUI/CLI both fail fast when required deps are unavailable
- Architecture split phase 2:
  - `src/core/scan_engine.py` + `src/ui/controllers/scan_controller.py` + `src/ui/controllers/scheduler_controller.py`
  - Operation flow extracted to `src/ui/controllers/operation_flow_controller.py`
  - Navigation flow extracted to `src/ui/controllers/navigation_controller.py`

Planned follow-up refactors:

- Further decomposition of heavy logic from `src/core/scanner.py`
- Additional service-level extraction from `src/ui/main_window_parts/*` when needed

## ✅ Implementation Status (2026-02-28)

The duplicate scan audit plan is now fully implemented:

- Cancel reliability hardened across full-hash, folder-duplicate, and mixed-mode stages.
  - Cancel now consistently emits `scan_cancelled`, stores session as `paused`, and avoids false `scan_finished`.
- Protected root folder guard added at scan-root level.
  - Protected roots are skipped entirely with explicit progress/status message.
- Extension normalization fixed.
  - `.txt` and `txt` now behave identically.
- Error telemetry added and exposed to UI/CLI/exported JSON.
  - Hashing and similar-image worker errors are no longer silently swallowed.
- Strict mode added (UI + CLI).
  - `--strict-mode`, `--strict-max-errors`
  - threshold exceeded => scan status `partial` (results still returned, CLI exit code remains `0`).
- Scan config hash canonicalization added for better baseline reuse.
  - normalized/sorted folders, extensions, include/exclude patterns.
- Baseline policy unchanged by design.
  - only `completed` sessions are baseline candidates (`partial` excluded).
- Manual/scheduled JSON export updated with `meta` while preserving backward compatibility on load.

## ✅ Implementation Status (2026-03-09)

- Main window was split by SOLID responsibilities while preserving public compatibility:
  - `src/ui/main_window.py` is now a lightweight assembly/compat layer.
  - Feature logic moved to `src/ui/main_window_parts/{ui_shell,scan_flow,results_flow,settings_flow,tools_flow,schedule_flow}.py`.
- Dynamic widget typing contract was added:
  - `src/ui/main_window_parts/typing_contract.py` defines `TYPE_CHECKING` attributes and host protocols.
  - `reportAttributeAccessIssue` remains strict; issues are fixed in code rather than relaxed in config.
- Pylance regression guardrails were locked:
  - Added `pyrightconfig.json` (scope: `src`, `tests`, `cli.py`, `main.py`; Python 3.14; key diagnostics set to `error`).
- Encoding regression guardrails were strengthened:
  - Added `.editorconfig` UTF-8/EOL rules.
  - `tests/test_source_encoding_integrity.py` checks UTF-8 decode, replacement-char bans, and known mojibake patterns.
- Baseline checks:
  - `pyright src tests cli.py main.py` remains at `0 errors`.
  - (As of 2026-03-09) full `pytest` could still terminate with `-1073740791`; this was tracked as a pre-existing baseline issue.

## ✅ Implementation Status (2026-03-11)

- CLI lifecycle hardening:
  - CLI now runs `ScanWorker.run()` synchronously instead of creating a dedicated Qt event loop.
  - This reduces process-global Qt lifecycle conflicts in CLI/GUI mixed usage.
- CLI mixed-mode behavior alignment:
  - `--mixed-mode` now always implies the similar-image pass (`--similar-image` is no longer required separately).
- File lock detection hardening:
  - Windows lock checks were updated to avoid zero-byte false-unlocked behavior.
- Incremental rescan reliability:
  - Deep subtree skipping based only on directory mtime was removed to reduce missed-file risk after baseline scans.
- Regression verification:
  - Full `pytest -q` baseline: `104 passed`.

## Performance Refactor Notes (2026-02)

- Hashing hot path now consumes pre-collected `(path, size, mtime)` tuples to avoid repeated `os.stat` calls.
- Hash/session cache lookup is processed in chunks to reduce memory spikes on large scans.
- Results tree rendering accepts injected metadata and applies filtering inside the widget for faster UI response.
- Selection persistence now uses delta upsert/delete instead of full-table rewrite on each change.
- Operation restore/purge flows now use batch quarantine item fetch with throttled progress updates.

## Performance Refactor Notes (2026-02-21)

- Added `ResultsTreeWidget.files_checked_delta(added, removed, selected_count)` while preserving `files_checked(list)` for compatibility.
- Results tree now uses dynamic batch rendering, filter short-circuit, and cached group summaries for faster large-result interaction.
- Introduced `ResultsController` and `PreviewController` to split selection/preview orchestration from `main_window` and reduce UI-thread blocking.
- Preview loading now uses async workers plus LRU caching to keep scrolling/selection responsive.
- Scanner now pre-compiles include/exclude matchers, throttles session progress DB writes independently from UI progress emits, and deduplicates session hash batch writes.
- Folder-duplicate full-hash computation now reuses the parallel hash pipeline instead of per-file synchronous hashing.
- Final `file_meta` is trimmed to result-referenced paths to lower memory peak on large scans.
- Operation queue now uses throttled progress for trash deletes and reduces repeated `exists/getsize/getmtime` calls in trash/hardlink paths.
- CSV export supports optional `file_meta` injection to avoid repeated filesystem stats when metadata is already available.

## Benchmark & Regression Guardrails

- Added deterministic performance regression tests:
  - `tests/test_scanner_perf_path.py`
  - `tests/test_results_tree_perf.py`
  - `tests/test_exporting.py`
  - `tests/test_main_window_selection_perf.py`
- Added local benchmark script (JSON output): `tests/benchmarks/bench_perf.py`

Example:

```bash
python tests/benchmarks/bench_perf.py --files 200000 --groups 5000 --output bench_perf.json
```
